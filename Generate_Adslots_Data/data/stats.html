<u>KDD Cup 2000 Column Statistics</u></h1></center>
To help you understand the data, we have provided "basic statistics" about
the columns (attributes) in the datasets.&nbsp; There are statistics for
each of the 5 data files (clicks, orders, q1_agg, q2_agg, and q3_agg).&nbsp;
All of the statistics are available in a single 29MB WinZip archive that
is encrypted with the same password as the data files.&nbsp; Download the
statistics <a href="stats.zip">here</a> (17.1M in WinZip). When you extract
the archive there will be a subdirectory for each of the 5 data files.&nbsp;
To view the statistics for a specific data file, point your browser to
the index.html file in the appropriate subdirectory.
<p>For each column, we provided the name, the type, the number of null
values and the number of non-null values.
<br>When the number of distinct values is small (less than 1000), we show
the number of distinct values.
<br>For discrete columns, we display the top 20 values.&nbsp; Ordered columns
are displayed in their natural ordering.
<br>For real-valued columns, the range is discretized into 10 equal width
bins and a histogram is given.&nbsp; The min/max/mean and std-dev are also
given.
<br>The column "Normalized" shows the percentages of the non-null values
in the distribution, which helps when the percentage of nulls is significant.
<p>If you plan to print this file, go ahead and put some paper in the printer;
it's about 170 pages.
<p><b>Important note:</b> <b>All the statistics are computed at the correct
granularity level.</b>
<br>Specifically, each attribute is valid at some level.&nbsp; Some attributes
are customer level attributes, some are session level, some are order header
level, some are order line level, some at the clickstream request level,
etc.&nbsp; The statistics are computed as if the data is collapsed to that
level to avoid incorrect statistics.&nbsp; For example:
<ul>
<li>
Request Query string and Request Referrer are at the clickstream request
level.&nbsp; That's why if you add up the non and non-null values, you'll
have 777,480 for each.</li>

<li>
Cookie first visit, session start login, session first refferer are all
at the session level, where there are 234,954 records.</li>

<li>
The attribute "Which do you wear most frequent" is a customer-level attribute.&nbsp;
All visitors that have not registered are collapsed into an "anonymous"
user and statistics are computed for the customers, resulting in 3,727
values.</li>

<br>Registered gender is similar, but note that many people have not filled
that question, so there are many nulls (most haven't filled it in because
the registration form does not ask for it any more).</ul>
Notes on columns:
<ul>
<li>
Some columns have the value "Choose," which indicates that the user left
the answer to the registration form as "choose."</li>

<br>In the dataset we gave out, we already mapped this value to unknown
(?).
<li>
Acxiom columns are most of the times only two valued: Null and True.&nbsp;
Acxiom rarely has negative information.&nbsp; For example, Motorcycle owner
is either null or true.&nbsp; We have mapped users that were found by Acxiom,
but whose value is Null to "false," which really means "presumably false."

You can always map the falses back to unknowns if you want to do so.&nbsp;
The nulls in the acxiom columns indicate that the person was not found
by Acxiom.&nbsp; Also, the Acxiom "DMA no XXX" (e.g., no mail solicitation)
is somewhat confusing because True means you can solicit.&nbsp; We chose
to leave the Acxiom column names and values as defined by Acxiom.</li>

<li>
The e-mail was stripped by us.&nbsp; It only reveals Gazelle and the suffix
(.com, .gov, etc).</li>

<li>
All the times are server time, i.e., Eastern-Standard Time (EST).</li>

<li>
As you can easily notice, some extreme values exist that are noisy (e.g,.
birth year is 1839 to 2089).&nbsp; No attempt was made by us to clean the
data nor to override the binning process, which defaults to splitting the
range into 10.</li>

<li>
There are many ID columns.&nbsp; What are they used for?&nbsp; They are
mostly used by us to do the star join (which you do not see), but IDs are
assigned in increasing order, so there is a good time component that may
be uncovered when using them.&nbsp; You can also use them to sort data
(e.g., sessions), when you want to split data into a train/test set based
on session by time.</li>
</ul>
