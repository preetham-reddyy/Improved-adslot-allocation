<h1>
<u>KDD Cup 2000 Evaluation Criteria</u></h1></center>

<center><b>Updated 7/31/2000</b></center>

<p><br>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>This document describes the questions and the evaluation criteria
that were used to rate the participants in KDD Cup 2000.
<br>Over 170 NDAs were received.&nbsp; 31 entries were submitted (called
participants below).
<br>A single winner was declared for each of the five questions.&nbsp;
One of the participants won two questions.
<br>Honorable mentions were given to other participants that were judged
as significant or very close to the winner.
<br>Questions one and two had one honorable mention each;&nbsp; Question
3 had two honorable mentions; Question 4 had three honorable mentions;
and Question 5 had no honorable mention.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
For questions 3,4,5, for which no simple objective measure exists, we talked
to retail experts at Gazelle and at Blue Martini about the submissions.
We then formalized the evaluations by collecting all of the significant
insights, weighting them, and creating a score based on a linear combination
of: the observations, the correctness of the submission, and the presentation.&nbsp;
The weights were as follows:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Presentation (0-10), weight 3: </b>How readable and easy to understand
is the presentation?&nbsp; Are there graphs, tables, and figures that business
people can understand?&nbsp; Was there an effort to distill the important
information, or are 37 graphs presented (one for each column with some
relationship), letting the business user figure things out?</li>

<li>
<b>Correctness (0-10), weight 3: </b>Are the claims correct (see <a href="#statsOnClipped">below</a>
for incorrect statistics when using clipped data)?&nbsp; Is the support
(number of matches) mentioned (see above for low support of purchases from
shopnow.com referrals)?</li>

<li>
<b>Bonus (0-10), weight 1:</b> Extra insight or observations that were
very interesting (but not necessarily an observation about the question).&nbsp;
We rarely awarded bonus points here and most participants got zero for
this factor.</li>

<li>
<b>Insights (0-2), varying weights:</b> As described below for each question,
there were many insight factors that were created as the union of all insights
from participants (e.g., over 30 for questions 3 and 4).&nbsp; Each participant
was ranked 0-2 on identifying each factor.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Many observations were given low weight (sometimes zero) because
they simply correlate with other more fundamental ones.
<br>For example, it is true (and not well known hence interesting) that
your palm size correlates with your life expectancy: the <b>larger your
palm</b>, the <b>less you will live, on average</b>.&nbsp; While this is
very interesting at first, once you factor the fact that females have smaller
palms (females live about 6 years longer than males in the U.S.), the effect
of palm size in the two populations disappears and the insight itself seems
much less interesting.
<br>A similar observation is that shoe size correlates with reading ability,
yet this is obvious once you factor in age: small children do not read
as well as teenagers.
<p>In our web mining data, many seemingly interesting observations are
obvious once you discover the underlying cause, usually time or session
length.&nbsp; Peeling the onion to find the underlying cause of many observations
is something many participants have failed to do.&nbsp; We spent significant
time peeling the onion ourselves on some of the "interesting observations,"
only to find out there was nothing left once you took time or session length
into account.&nbsp; Some examples
<ul>
<li>
SendEmail indicates is a registration form question where users are asked
whether they would like Gazelle to send them e-mail.</li>

<br>Many participants noted the correlation between this and other factors,
such as being a "heavy" spender (question 3).&nbsp; However, few participants
plotted the response to this question over time to discover that it varied
dramatically in time.&nbsp; We asked Gazelle about this and they mentioned
that the default was changed from yes to no around early March (looks like
2/29) and that it was changed again afterwards.&nbsp; This is a great example
of something that was not conveyed to us (and therefore the participants)
early, yet some participants discovered it. <a href="sendEmail1.gif">click
to see</a>
<li>
Several other attributes from the initial registration form that were not
used in the second registration form are also simply predictors of time.</li>

<li>
Only a few participants noted that Donna Karan wasn't available on the
site prior to 2/26! <a href="brandViews1.gif">click to see</a></li>

<li>
Many participants noticed that referrers had significant effects, but referrers
are unstable over time. Some referrers lasted for very short periods (e.g.,
mycoupons) and some started late (winnie-cooper) <a href="referrers1.gif">click
to see.</a></li>

<li>
Some participants forgot that high percentage is meaningless if the support
is small.&nbsp; For example, some participants mentioned that all (100%)
of customers referred by FashionMall.com and ShopNow.com were "heavy spenders"
for question 3, but did not realize that the actual number of purchases
was extremely small: 17 and 6.</li>

<blockquote>An interesting point is how the conversion rates differ (we
ignore <a href="winnie.jpg">winnie-cooper visitors</a> who may be looking
for pictures more than actual items to purchase).&nbsp; The ratio of conversion
rates between mycoupons.com and shopnow.com is 207!&nbsp; Of course (as
seen below in question 3), the buyers from mycoupons are usually low spenders,
but their contribution over time needs to be assessed.&nbsp; Acquisition
costs could go as high as $200 per customer, so spending $10 on a promotion
might certainly be useful if the person might come back later and spend
more money without the coupon.</blockquote>
<a NAME="statsOnClipped"></a>The most common mistake for questions 4 and
5 was reporting statistics based on the aggregated training data without
filtering out the clipped sessions.&nbsp; Because the data consists of
two populations, one of which (the continue label) is clipped (or right
censored in statistics terminology), computations that depend on the sessions
being complete are incorrect.&nbsp; Participants should have filtered out
the continue/clipped sessions that are marked and generated statistics
from the rest of the data, which represents the actual distributions.&nbsp;
The best example is the probability of exiting after k pages, which Jorge
from e-steam highlighted.&nbsp; Participants that computed the statistics
based on the training set (ratio of continue to leave) had dramatically
<b>wrong</b>
statistics.&nbsp; For example, several reported 87.33% for exiting at the
first page while the true number is 61.35%.&nbsp; Furthermore, the whole
trend for abandonment is incorrect: based on the training data label, it
seems that the probability of leaving the site increases initially but
the real calculation shows that it is decreasing.&nbsp; <a href="abandonment1.gif">Click
to see.</a>
<br>A related mistake was to count visitors using the training set in question
3.&nbsp; These are only visitors that purchased something.</blockquote>

<h2>
Questions and Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<blockquote><font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Questions 1: Given a set
of page views, will the visitor view another page on the site or will the
visitor leave?</font></font>
<blockquote><b>Motivation: </b>the ability to predict whether a visitor
will leave can help determine the best page to display (e.g., there may
be three alternative pages a site can display in response to a given link
and each can be evaluated on the likelihood that it will cause the user
to leave) or action can be taken to encourage the visitor to stay (e.g.,
special promotion).
<p><b>Evaluation criteria: </b>the ratio of correct predictions on the
test set (0-1 loss).
<br>The winner was the participant with the highest accuracy.
<br>We looked at the accuracy on non-trivial sessions (5 or more clicks)
and awarded an honorable mention to the participant with the highest accuracy,
who happened to have the second highest accuracy for all sessions.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Questions 2: Given a set of page views,
which product brand (Hanes, Donna Karan, American Essentials, on none)
will the visitor view in the remainder of the session?</font></font>
<blockquote><b>Motivation: </b>If you could put a single dynamic link (e.g.,
picture and URL) on the current page, pointing to a brand, which brand
would you choose?&nbsp; To make the problem manageable, we are asking you
to predict one of three common brands, or other.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Evaluation criteria:&nbsp;</b> score on the test set determined
as follows: 2 units if the session visited the predicted brand, 1 unit
if the session did not visit any of the three brands and the prediction
was none; 0 otherwise.
<br>The winner was the participant with the highest score and the second
highest score for non-trivial sessions (5 or more clicks).
<br>The honorable mention went to the participant with the second highest
score who had the highest score on the non-trivial sessions.</blockquote>
<font color="#000099"><font size=+1>Question 3: Given a set of purchases
over a period of time, characterize visitors who spend more than $12 (order
amount) on an average order at the site.</font></font>
<blockquote><b>Submission requirement: </b>text and graphs that a business
user will understand and will believe are useful.
<br>The text is limited to 1,000 words, and up to 10 graphs with captions
not exceeding 3 lines each.
<p><b>Motivation: </b>insight can be valuable for determining the business
directions, marketing decisions, etc.
<p><b>Insights:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Weight=9:&nbsp; </b>Identification of factors related to time (e.g.,
account creation or order line date) and noting that the site had significant
activity starting Feb 29 with the TV ad and the Friends promotion driving
significant traffic.&nbsp; The initial period until Feb 29 is usually called
soft-launch where friends and family are asked to visit the site but and
limited marketing activities happen.&nbsp; On Feb 29 (note the interesting
Y2K leap year date :-)&nbsp; the real traffic started.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=8: </b>Attributes changed in the two registration forms (we said
this in the intro document but it was ignored by many participants who
found attributes that were simply surrogates for time).&nbsp; The <a href="sendEmail1.gif">send
e-mail attribute had a very different distribution during Feb 28 to March
15</a>.</li>

<ol>
<li>
33.48% hear from friend / family; avg. order amt. $8.80 (lowest)</li>

<li>
2.79% heard from print ad; avg. order amt. $36.82 (highest)</li>

<li>
29.27% heared from other; avg. order amt. $32.19 (2nd highest)</li>
</ol>
Note that NULL is simply a surrogate for time again.
<li>
<b>Weight=5:</b> High home market values correlated with heavy spenders.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=6</b>: Which do you wear most frequently- athletic and casual
socks implied low spenders.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=9: </b>Friend promotion attracted many low spenders.&nbsp; More
generally, customers that used discounts were low spenders even ignoring
the discount itself.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=4:</b> Registration form questions: Send e-mail, number of children
imply heavy (indirectly indicate time but they didn't notice observation
#2 above).</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=6</b>: Geography was a factor.&nbsp; Northeast U.S. states had
more heavy spenders.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=5:</b> Work dress (in questionnaire) is business casual or business
dress implies heavy spender.</li>

<br>Note this attribute was non-null starting Feb 26.&nbsp; Heavy spenders
are 18% after Feb 29, but those who dress business are 25.6% of the heavy
spenders.
<li>
<b>Weight=7: </b>Referrals from Mycoupons (170) are very low spenders;
shopnow (6) or fashionmall (17) are heavy spenders 100% of the time (note
the low support for shopnow).&nbsp; See table <a href="#conversionTable">above</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=0:</b> Purchases of black products imply heavy spenders.</li>

<br>Although our retail experts were able to explain that black is fashionable,
sophisticated, upscale, we were unable to verify this.&nbsp; There are
two attributes that mention black.&nbsp; The one that does have correlation
with spending was not used after 2/25, so this is simply a correlation
with time.
<li>
<b>Weight =0: </b>Registration form "Buy for others" implies heavy spender
(93%).</li>

<br>Similarly, how many pairs do you purchase and who makes purchases for
you, etc.
<br>These are simply identifying purchasers before 2/25.&nbsp; Exactly
93% of them are heavy purchasers (80/86), but they are not predictive attribute
for the future.
<li>
<b>Weight=6:</b> Vehicle lifestyle of luxury implies heavy spender, truck
implies low spender.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=3:</b> Product views such as Donna Karan imply heavy spender.&nbsp;
Views of American Essentials imply low spender.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=6</b>: Very High income and very low income imply high spenders</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=6: </b>Year of birth - older implies heavier spenders (age)</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=3:</b> Legware of one size implies low spender.</li>

<br>This decreases the heavy spenders from 24% to 14% with very high support.
<li>
<b>Weight=4:</b> Pantyhose are preferred by high spenders, socks by low
spenders</li>

<br>(this may be simply explained by the fact that pantyhose are more expensive).
<li>
<b>voided insight.</b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Weight=8: </font></b>home vendor is generating
heavy spender purchases</li>

<ol>
<li>
lifestyle assortments has 47% with 25 people</li>

<li>
assortment->detail leg wear has 35% with 180 people</li>

<li>
free gift generates cheap orders</li>
</ol>

<li>
<b>Weight=8: </b>Similar to #10, but with additional referrers such as
freedeals, flamingo (can't get #10 in this case).</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=2:</b> Children in house imply heavier spender</li>

<br>There are two columns indicating children.&nbsp; 'numberofchildren'
is from the gazelle registration form and 'presence_of_children' is from
Acxiom.&nbsp; Interestingly, they have opposite correlations with heavy
spenders.
<br>The registration 'numberofchildern' being non-NULL is a strong indication
of heavy spenders but it is just a surrogate for having an early order
date.&nbsp; Of the orderlines with a non-NULL value for numberofchildern,
196 are before 2/28 and only 51 are after it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The support for
these, however, is very slim in most cases.
<ol>
<li>
0 children imply heavy spender with 93.22% (55/59)</li>

<li>
1 child imply heavy spender with 100.00%&nbsp;&nbsp; (6/6)</li>

<li>
2 children imply heavy spender with 92.86% (13/14)</li>

<li>
3 children imply heavy spender with 100% (1/1)</li>

<li>
4 or more children imply heavy spender with 50% (1/2)</li>

<li>
NULL implies heavy spender with 19.90% (348/1749) (baseline is 24%)</li>
</ol>
The Acxiom 'presence_of_children' value being true is a reasonable indication
of non-heavy spenders (brings 24% heavy spenders down to 13%).&nbsp; Both
false and NULL values increase the likelihood of heavy spenders to about
30%, whereas true implies heavy spender with 12.9%.
<li>
<b>Weight=6: </b>legcare implies high spender (not legware).</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=4</b>: Dressing room for heavy spenders</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if null correlates with time: heavy
24% to 67% (199 customers)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true increases from 24% to 31% (329
customers)
<li>
<b>Weight=4:</b> Waist control CT versus Null.&nbsp; CT and STW imply heavy.
Similarly Sheer implies heavy.</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waist control increases from 24% to
43% covers 409
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheer is similar 24% to 44% and covers
380
<li>
<b>Weight=7: </b>AOL users spend less</li>

<br>Note that Gazelle explained this by saying that their site was not
tested on AOL browsers and did not work very well.&nbsp; For example, some
buttons were outside the AOL default frame size.
<li>
<b>Weight=4: </b>Marital status.&nbsp; Married implies low spender.</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=7: </b>50% of customers who visited 4 times are heavy spenders</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=5: </b>Monday is heavy spenders day.</li>

<br>Wednesday has peak traffic.
<li>
<b>Weight=7:</b> Ignoring discount, they're still cheap if they use promotions</li>

<li>
<b>Weight=4:</b> Big cities imply heavy spenders (where big cities are
defined by the number of visits from each city).</li>

<br>Mostly true, but note that LA and Arlington have a rate less than the
default.
