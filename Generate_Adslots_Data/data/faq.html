<u>KDD Cup 2000 FAQ</u></h1></center>

<ol>
<li>
5/27/00 The problem is really hard!&nbsp; I can barely get the accuracy
down.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong?</li>

<br>The problems are really hard.&nbsp; In fact, many algorithms will do
worse than predicting the majority class.
<br>However, getting even a small improvement may be significant, especially
if some predictions are high confidence.
<br>For example:
<ul>
<li>
It is very hard to guess whether a session will end or what a user will
browse given a single page view.</li>

<br>However, perhaps it is possible to make such predictions for sessions
of length 5 or more.
<li>
There may be attributes that need to be created.&nbsp; With these attributes,
the problem may be easier.</li>
</ul>

<li>
5/23/00 In the names file, some fields are marked as "ignore."&nbsp; What
does this field type mean and are we allowed to use it?</li>

<br>The names file format we supplied lists all the values for a column.&nbsp;
When there are many values (over 100 distinct) or when there is a single
value, we mark the column as ignore.&nbsp; Such attributes have very little
value for data mining algorithms like C4.5 or C5.0.&nbsp; You may want
to construct higher level features with fewer values, or you may have an
algorithm that can deal better than C4.5/C5.0 with such attributes.
<br>Other attribute types are:
<ul>
<li>
continuous: the values are either integer or float</li>

<li>
date: date values in the format of "yyyy-MM-dd"</li>

<li>
time: time values in the format of "HH\:mm\:ss"</li>

<li>
a list of discrete values: unordered discrete values</li>

<li>
[ordered] + a list of discrete values: ordered discrete values (the order
of the values makes semantic sense).</li>
</ul>
More information about the C5.0 format can be found in <a href="http://www.rulequest.com/see5-win.html">http://www.rulequest.com/see5-win.html</a>
at the RuleQuest web site.&nbsp; Note that the available version of C5.0
does not support "time" (we added this ourselves).
<li>
5/26/00 Some sessions in the Clicks dataset have a very large numbers of
pages (in thousands).&nbsp; How can this be explained?</li>

<br>Welcome to the WWW where bots and crawlers visit. Several thousand
hits per session are common for crawlers.&nbsp; We suggest you look at
the "User agent" column, which the browser sends as its identification.&nbsp;
Sometimes it will disclose itself as a crawler; other times it will have
a slightly different variant of a true browser, and at times it will just
hide itself as any other browser.&nbsp; Some examples are given in <a href="http://mosa.unity.ncsu.edu/~brabec/antispam.html">http://mosa.unity.ncsu.edu/~brabec/antispam.html</a>
<li>
5/26/00 Are the non-Acxiom demographic fields (things likeYourFavoriteLegcareBrand)
self-reported?</li>

<br>Yes.&nbsp; The questions were asked during registration.&nbsp; Note,
however, that (as is very typical of new sites), the registration questions
changed several times during the period in which the data was logged, and
hence some customers who registered have values for one set of questions
and other customers who registered have values for another set of questions.
<li>
5/26/00 Will Acxiom demographic data be part of the test data set as well?</li>

<br>Yes.&nbsp; However, you must realize that Acxiom demographics only
exist for users who have registered (and given their name/address).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the questions with a test set (1,2,4,5), this represents a very small
portion of the visitors.&nbsp; Also, a registered user may come back to
the site and not login (cookie tricks may help you match, but there are
few repeat visitors in the short duration we have).
<li>
5/26/00 Does the value of '?' indicate a missing value (NULL) as it does
in C4.5 and C5.0?</li>

<br>Yes.&nbsp; Note, however, that based on some feedback about unknown
versus inapplicable, the updated dataset to be released 5/27/00 will specify
NULL instead of "?" for booleans.&nbsp; The unknowns (?) will still exist
for categorical where the semantics is more appropriate.
<li>
5/26/00 Is the combination of "Session ID" and "Request Sequence" a unique
identifier for every record?</li>

<br>For the clicks dataset, it is.
<li>
5/26/00&nbsp; Is the attribute "Order Line Session ID" in the clicks dataset
the same as "Session ID" in the order dataset?</li>

<br>Yes!&nbsp; Most columns that have the same name (e.g., user id) will
match across the two tables.
<li>
5/26/00 Should the answer to Content Question #5 be provided in terms of
visitors (demographics), in terms of sessions, or either?</li>

<br>Either, i.e., any insight that would interest a business user is reasonable.
<li>
5/27/00 Viewed Brand in the clicks dataset has several values.&nbsp; What
is NULL?</li>

<br>Null means that the page view is not a product details page.
<li>
5/27/00 Order Amount is sometimes zero or a small negative number.&nbsp;
What does it mean?</li>

<br>Zero purchases are possible with coupons and Gaezlle had a $10 off
coupon promotion with no minimum price.
<br>We're asking Gazelle to explain the small negative amounts.
<li>
5/28/00 Could you be as specific as possible in describing the differences
between the web site during the period Jan 30, 2000-April 1, 2000 and the
site today?</li>

<br>One of the hallmarks of the Blue Martini system is the ability to change
something and stage a new site while it is up and running.&nbsp; Gazelle
has staged 190 versions of the site since they started building the site.&nbsp;
Fifty five (55) of those were done from Jan 30 to April 1st, so we could
not easily describe all the changes.&nbsp; The most obvious changes were:
<ul>
<li>
Change in the registration form.&nbsp; As you can see, some customer attributes
are null after a certain period, indicating they were not asked any more,
while others started getting values late.</li>

<li>
New promotions.&nbsp; The common ones are described in the <a href="intro.html">introduction
document.</a></li>

<li>
New product introductions.&nbsp; Over time, the number of products and
brands grew significantly.</li>

<br>Our system has a notion of an object (products, product attribute value,
template, promotion, basically any object).&nbsp; On Jan 30, there were
6,262 object; on Feb 15 there were 11,742; on Feb 28 there were 14,767;
on March 15 there were 16,146; and on March 31 there were 17,281.&nbsp;
As you can see, the site is live and growing, which makes the problem harder.&nbsp;
The good news is that product and assortment ids that we log are stable,
so when you see a product logged, it remains the same product even if templates
changes are made or it gets additional attributes, etc.</ul>

<li>
5/29/00 In aggregated file for question 2 there are records with several
target fields marked as "True" at the same time.&nbsp; For example record
with SessionID = 109 has following data:</li>

<ol><font size=-1>Num Hanes Viewed Later&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2</font>
<br><font size=-1>Num AmericanEssentials Viewed Later&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</font>
<br><font size=-1>Num DonnaKaran Viewed Later&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0</font>
<br><font size=-1>No Top Brand Viewed Later = False</font></ol>
&nbsp;which means that in the remainder of the session the visitor will
view 2 pages of Hanes and 1 page of AmericanEssensials. The question is:What
should be predicted in such case (Hanes or AmericanEssentials) ?
<br><tt>Answer: </tt>You will get the maximum, i.e., two points if you
predict either Hanes or AmericanEssentials.&nbsp; Given the motivation
in our docs (a single link on the page to the brand) that defines the evaluation
criteria, you should predict the brand with the higher confidence of a
visit in the remainder of the session.
<li>
5/30/00 In the answer to question 5 above, we mention that Acxiom demographics
only exist for users who have registered (and given their name/address).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the questions with a test set (1,2,4,5), this represents a very small
portion of the visitors. However, the given statistics show that&nbsp;&nbsp;
majority of Axiom's columns have more than 50% of non-null records, such
Gender. Why?</li>

<br>The reason is that this statistics is computed at the customer level
using Customer ID. That is, each customer with a unique Customer ID is
counted once. Since all unregistered visitors have no customer ID (null),
they are treated as a single customer (with null as the ID value) during
this statistics calculation.
<br>Therefore, the number of "Null Values" here is the number of registered
customers for whom Acxiom does not found Gender + 1.
<li>
5/30/00 What do "Order Line" and "Order" mean?</li>

<br>Each "order" can have one or more "order lines."&nbsp; For example,
in a single order you can buy 2 pairs of socks A and 1 bottle of body cream
B.&nbsp; This order will have two order lines -- one for socks A and one
for body cream B.
<br>An example of an order line variable is "Order Line Quantity" which
indicates the number of units ordered.&nbsp; In the order above this would
be "2" for the socks and "1" for the cream.
<br>An example of an order variable is "Order Amount" which is the total
amount of money spent for the entire order.&nbsp; This includes the amount
of money spent for each order line as well as tax and shipping.
<li>
5/30/00 What does the "HasDressingRoom" column mean?</li>

<br>Gazelle.com has a feature, called "dressing room", that allows you
to see the visual effect of a product such as when wearing a Thigh High.

You can change skin tone and hosiery and color there. The attribute HasDressingRoom
tells whether a product has this feature or not.
<li>
5/30/00 What does LeadTime mean?</li>

<br>Time in days from when a product is ordered to when it is expected
to be receipted in the fulfillment center and available for sale.
<li>
5/30/00 What do KS,TS,ML,OC, andPA in Socktype1 &amp; Socktype2 stand for?</li>

<br>KS: knee socks
<br>TS: trouser socks,
<br>ML: mid-length
<br>OC: over-the-calf
<br>PA: peds and ankle-highs
<li>
5/30/00 What do MAS, BKS, BDCS, MCS, KP, TH, LG, MDS, TT, WAS, WDCS, FO,
LEO, GDCS and PH in CategoryCode stand for?</li>

<br>MAS: men's athletic socks
<br>BKS: bike shorts
<br>BDCS: boy's dress/casual socks
<br>MCS: men's casual socks
<br>KP: knee-highs/peds
<br>TH: thigh-highs
<br>LG: leggings
<br>MDS: men's dress socks
<br>TT: tights
<br>WAS: women's athletic socks
<br>WDCS: women's dress/casual socks
<br>FO: fashion/other
<br>LEO: leotards
<br>GDCS: girl's dress/casual socks
<br>PH: pantyhose
<li>
5/30/00 What do CT and STW in WaistControl: CT and STW stand for?</li>

<br>CT: control top
<br>STW: sheer-to-waist
<li>
5/30/00 What do UBC, MBC, BS and LBC in BodyFeature stand for?</li>

<br>Gazelle.com doesn't use body feature. This is used as place-holders.
<li>
6/3/00 What does "Last Page" or "Last" in some aggregated column names
mean?</li>

<br>In the aggregated data for question 1 and question 2, it means that
this column contains the value of the last request in a session for the
corresponding column in the un-aggregated data. In the aggregated data
for question 3, it means that this column contains the value of the last
request in the last session for the corresponding column in the un-aggregated
data.
<br>For example, "Texture Last" in q3_agg means the texture of the product
viewed in the last page of the last session (it has value null if this
page is not a product detail page); "Session Last Template" in q2_agg means
the template of the last page of a session.
<li>
6/5/00 Will the test set be in the same format as the training set?&nbsp;
Will it be from the data collected in the .jhtml format or the .jsp format
that gazelle.com is currently using?</li>

<br>The test dataset is in the same format as the training set for each
question if applicable. Both of them were collected in the .jhtml format.
<li>
7/10/00 What is the equivalent of a static URL in the dataset?</li>

<br>Template + Query string (where + means concatenate).
<li>
7/10/00 Is there a unique key in the data?</li>

<br>Session-id and sequence form a unique key.
<li>
7/10/00 What is the meaning of gazelle.com&nbsp; being a referral site
to itself?</li>

<br>This might happen sometimes. For example, when a customer visits the
gazelle.com
<br>site and stops at a place for a while. This makes the session time
out. If the customer
<br>restarts the visit, a new session will be created. In this case the
referral of the
<br>second session will be gazelle.com.
<li>
7/10/00 At which situations should we expect the value of&nbsp; "session
last query string" to be NULL ?</li>

<br>Normally, query string contains parameters passed to the page. Some
<br>page may not have parameters. In this case, query string is null.
<br>"Session last query string" is the query string of the last page of
the
<br>session in the data set. Note that this page may not be the ending
page
<br>of the session, because we clipped some sessions when creating the
<br>datasets. This column is computed by us based on the training portion
<br>only, so there is no "leak" of the target.
<li>
7/10/00 What exactly is a "Dressing Room" ?</li>

<br>Could you please refer us to one product/page that has it?
<br>Gazelle.com has a feature, called "dressing room", that allows you
to see the visual effect of a product
<br>such as when wearing a Thigh High

<br>. You can change skin tone and hosiery and color there. The attribute
HasDressingRoom tells whether a
<br>product has this feature or not.
<li>
7/10/00 Will the reports be printed in color for the "judges" ?</li>

<br>Yes. Please tell this when submitting.
<li>
7/10/00 Please confirm that the following sentence provided in the instructions
is still true:</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the test set that you will get for question
1, the above set of page views has a 50% of being clipped in the middle."
<br>This question is asked because an 80:20 distribution was seen in the
training data set.
<br>Yes.
<br>Please note that if a session is chosen to clip, but its length is
1, it will not be clipped actually
<br>because the clip point is always great than or equal to 1.
<li>
7/10/00 'Send Email?' attribute. What does it mean? Who sends email to
whom and when?</li>

<br>Send Email is an attribute from Gazelle's registration page where the
customer registering can specify
<br>if he/she wants to receive email from Gazelle.
<li>
7/10/00 'Unknown card?' attribute (Acxiom). How can Gazelle use an unknown
card?</li>

<br>The 'Unknown card' attribute from Acixom indicates if the customer
<br>has a credit card that is not of a known type (gas card, bank card,
<br>upscale card). So a true here indicates that the customer has a
<br>credit card but Acxiom does not know the type. This field has nothing
to do with the credit card used by
<br>the customer to purchase products from Gazelle's web site.
<li>
7/10/00 'Home Market Value' attribute (Acxiom). Does this attribute have
any relevance to e.g. people that does not own their homes?</li>

<br>Home market value is the value of their current home. They may or
<br>may not be home owners. In some cases they may be home owners but
<br>Acxiom may not know about it.
<li>
7/10/00 'Number of Credit Lines' attribute (Acxiom). What exactly is a
credit line?</li>

<br>This corresponds to the number of credit cards the customer has (or
that
<br>Acxiom knows about).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Amount Sum Percent Having Discount
Range 0</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order amounts which do not have discount) / (sum of all
order amounts).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Amount Sum Percent Having Discount
Range (5 ... 10]</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order amounts each of which has a discount ranging from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $5 to $10 (not including
$5 but including $10)) / (sum of all order amounts).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order item Quantity Sum Percent Having
Discount Range (0 ... 5]</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of the numbers of items in the orders with a discount ranging
from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 to $5 ( 0&lt; ... &lt;= $5)) / (sum
of the numbers of items in all the orders).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Amount Sum Percent On Tuesday</b>"
in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order amounts purchased on Tuesday) / (sum of all order
amounts).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Percent of Products Purchased on Thursday</b>"
in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of the numbers of items purchased on Thursday) / (sum of
the numbers of all items purchase).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Line Amount Sum Percent Hanes</b>"
in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order line amounts of products of "/Products/Legwear/Hanes")
/
<br>&nbsp; (sum of order line amounts of all products).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Line Quantity Sum Percentage blue</b>"
in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of&nbsp; order line quantity of products with MyLegsColorRef
= blue) /
<br>&nbsp; (sum of order line quantity of all products).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Line Quantity Sum Percent With DressingRoom</b>"
in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order line quantity of products with HasDressingRoom
= true) /
<br>&nbsp; (sum of order line quantity of all products).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order Line Quantity Sum Percent Of Childrens
Dance Collection</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (sum of order line quantity of products belonging to Children's
Dance Collection) /
<br>&nbsp; (sum of order line quantity of all products).
<li>
7/11/00 What does the column "<b>Order line Day of Week First:</b>" in
q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>the day of week when the first order line is submitted.
<li>
7/11/00 In Question 1 aggregated data, why all the following columns have
value 0 in some rows?</li>

<br>Num main Template Views, Num products Template Views, Num articles
Template Views, Num account Template Views, Num checkout Template Views.
It seems that there are only these 5 template categories.
<p>These columns were generated through pivoting the number of page views
by the "Content Level 2 Path" column. This column has 7 possible values:
main, products, articles, checkout,&nbsp; account, Replenish, and include.
Due to that Replenish and include occur in very small percentages of records
in the training set (0.03% and &lt;0.01%), we didn't generate new columns
for them. Besides, the "Content Level 2 Path" column may have null value
if errors occurred and no template was created during page view.
<br>Therefore, it is possible that&nbsp; in some rows all of these columns
have value 0.
<li>
7/13/00 For question 2, is there a difference between predicting 'Other'
(The user will visit&nbsp; another product detail page.) and predicting
'NULL' (The user will not visit any product details page at all.)?&nbsp;
The 'NULL' prediction incorporates that the visitor only visits other pages
than product detail pages in the rest of his session or that the visitor
does not visit any further pages at all, i.e. the given sessions ends.</li>

<br>The prediction for each session must be one of the 4 classes: "Hanes",
"DonnaKaran", "AmericanEssentials", and "Other". "NULL" mentioned in the
class should be included in "Other".
<br>Question 2 has 4 classes:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Hanes</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (View Hanes Later)</li>

<li>
<b>DonnaKaran</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (View DonnaKaran Later)</li>

<li>
<b>AmericanEssentials</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (View AmericanEssentials Later)</li>

<li>
<b>Other</b> (including any situation that does NOT have Hanes brand views,
nor DonnaKaran brand views, nor AmericanEssentials brand views later. This
includes no further page views.)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The prediction for each session must be one of the 4 classes: "<b>Hanes</b>",
"<b>DonnaKaran</b>", "<b>AmericanEssentials</b>", and "<b>Other</b>". "NULL"
mentioned above should be included in "Other".</ul>

<li>
7/13/00 Why is Order Amount not equal to the sum of Order Line Amount for
a given order? When the orders dataset is rolled up by order, the mean
of Order Amount is 14.0184224, yet the sum of Order Line Amount is 20.8958044.</li>

<br>Two factors here:
<ul>
<li>
Order line amount does not include shipping charges.&nbsp; Shipping is
assigned to an entire order, but is not distributed to order lines.</li>

<li>
Discounts can be applied at the order level or the order line level.&nbsp;
Gazelle had a lot of sales with $10 off order level discounts.&nbsp; This
probably accounts for the average sum order line amount being higher than
average order amount.</li>
</ul>

<li>
7/14/00 What does the column "<b>Percent Order Promotion FRIEND</b>" in
q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>For each customer,
<br>100 * (the number of orders with the "Friend" promotion) / (the number
of all orders).
<li>
7/14/00 What does the column "<b>Order Date Recency</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>Days since last order.
<li>
7/14/00 What does the column "<b>Order Date Frequency</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>Expected number of orders per year (estimated based on orders so far).
<li>
7/14/00 What does the column "<b>Height Sum</b>" in q3_agg mean?</li>

<br>The sum of heights of products viewed by this customer. Note that some
products may not have the Height attribute.
<li>
7/14/00 What does the column&nbsp; "<b>Collection Last</b>"&nbsp;&nbsp;
in q1_agg mean?</li>

<br>The value of the attribute "Collection" of the product viewed in the
last page if any. Some example values of the Collection" attribute are:
Specialty Items, Childrens Dance, and Oroblu Fashion Line.
<li>
7/14/00 For question 3, 4, or 5, can we write a report of more than one
page (say 2-3) that does not exceed 1000 words overall?</li>

<br>Yes.
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Session visit count</b>" mean in q1_agg data?</li>

<br>Number of visits from the cookie at the time of the session.
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Num articles/dpt_about_mgmtteam Template Views</b>"
mean in q1_agg data?</li>

<br>It's the number of pages viewed with "Content Level 3 Path" = "/Content/templates/articles/dpt_ablut_mgmtteam.jhtml".
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Num main/login2 Template Views</b>" mean in q1_agg
data?</li>

<br>The number of pages viewed with "Content Level 3 Path" = "/Content/templates/main/login2.jhtml".
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Num main/registration Template Views</b>" mean in
q1_agg data?</li>

<br>The number of pages viewed with "Content Level 3 Path" = "/Content/templates/main/registration.jhtml".
<li>
7/15/00 What is the difference between assortment views and&nbsp; product
views?</li>

<br>A product view tells a page viewed containing the product.
<br>A assortment view tells a page viewed containing a product of that
assortment or a page related to that assortment. In addition, the assortment
id in the clickstream data is sticky in the sense that, once it is set
for viewing an assortment, it remains set on subsequent page requests until
a new assortment is viewed.&nbsp; So, assortment id on a page request actually
indicates the latest assortment viewed in the session.
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Session Last Template Top 5</b>" mean in q1_agg data?</li>

<br>The request template of the last page viewed (in the dataset rather
than in the true session). This column has the template if it is one of
the 5 most common values; "Other" otherwise.
<li>
7/15/00 What does "<b>Session First Referrer Top 5</b>" mean in q1_agg?</li>

<br>The referrer of the first page of the session. This column has the
referrer if it is one of the 5 most common values; "Other" otherwise.
<li>
7/17/00 Why does the average first prossessing time is 752 ms in the question1
aggregated data set and only 292 ms in the question1 aggregated test set?&nbsp;<br>
Gazelle changed their site, and it's noticed that the compile time is reduced.
In addition, the site simply became more stable. Every time the application
server is restarted, or when new content is staged, the first access to
a page causes a recompile of that page's jhtml, which takes about 5-10
seconds. If you look at access times for first pages excluding pages that
took more than 5 seconds, you'll see</li>

<br>&nbsp; training set: 153 ms
<br>&nbsp; test set: 130 ms
<br>much closer.For up to 10 seconds, it's 208 ms versus 161 ms.&nbsp;
Again, reasonably close.
<li>
7/17/00 There are a few new content templates in the test data set:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Content/templates/account/create_credit.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/account/edit_credit.jhtml</li>
</ul>
Do these templates replace other templates?
<br>If yes: Can You please name the previous templates' names.
<br>If no: What is the busines function of these new templates?
<br>On the other hand, there are a few content templates missing in the
test set that were present in the training data set:
<ul>
<li>
Content/templates/account/billing_info.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/checkout/billing.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/checkout/creditcard.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/checkout/shipping.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/main/update_credit_card.jhtml</li>

<li>
Content/templates/main/update_user_address.jhtml</li>
</ul>
Did You replace these templates by templates that provide the same functionality
but that have a different name?
<p>The end client, i.e., Gazelle, is doing these changes, not Blue Martini.
Blue Martini provides the infrastructure to build the web sites, but the
clients build the .jhtml and change them often.&nbsp; This is one of the
problems with a live web site and the main reason that Blue Martini logs
events and clickstreams at the semantic level, including products, assortments,
etc.

<p>Gazelle streamlined some of their processes between the train and test
period, which caused some of their templates to change.
<ul>
<li>
account/create_credit.jhtml&nbsp;&nbsp; Used for creating a credit card.</li>

<li>
account/edit_credit.jhtml&nbsp; Used for updating a credit card.</li>

<li>
account/create_address.jhtml&nbsp; Used for creating an address.</li>

<li>
account/edit_address.jhtml&nbsp; Used for updating an address.</li>
</ul>
Most of their checkout procedure has been replaced by a streamlined express
checkout which uses the checkout/expresscheckout.jhtml template.
<li>
7/17/00 What does "<b>Session First Request Date</b>" means?</li>

<br>Generally, if the string has First or Last then it is the first/last
entry from the unaggregated data. This is therefore the date+time of the
first request in the session.
<li>
7/17/00 What does "<b>Collection Last</b>" means?<br>
Collection from the last record in the session. Collection&nbsp; is a Gazelle
attribute, such as Women's Summer Spectator Collection.</li>

<li>
7/17/00 What does "<b>Session First Content ID</b>" means?</li>

<br>Content ID is a unique identifier for the template used to display
the page.
<li>
7/17/00 What does "<b>Num BrandOrder Assortnment views</b>" means?</li>

<br>The column assortment path in the unaggregated data can take multiple
values. In the aggregated data, this is a pivot/count of the value BrandOrder,
i.e., we count how many times BrandOrder appeared in the assortment.
<li>
7/17/00 Does the event of purchasing occur at the ExpressCheckout page?
or at the confirm_order page? In other words, when is the shopping information
sent to the site?</li>

<br>At the confirm_order page.</ol>
